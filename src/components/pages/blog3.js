    Today I decided to play with my usual squad. My 
    usual squad consists of me, stoop, fizzy and acid. We work
    together well and usually win a lot of games. We played for about an
    hour and won no games, but then took a short break to eat. After we ate, we went
    on a tear. We won 11 games in a row and then continued to win some more 
    afterwards. At one point we became so confident in our skill, we pushed every
    team we saw and just built on top of them. We won the game and I had 21 kills, my highest,
    and we had 36 as a team. We were so close to dropping 40 kills as a squad. I ended the night
    with 501 wins. My next goal is to drop 40 kills with my teammates!
