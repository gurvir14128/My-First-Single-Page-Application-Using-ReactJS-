    The new costumers came out in fortnite today. I bought the 
    raven skin right away. It has a very dark vibe to it and reminds
    me of xur from the videogame destiny. Fortnite also, introduced 
    a new rocket launcher to the videogame You are able to control
    the rocket launcher manually and it has a huge blast radius. I 
    immediatly found one in a supply create. I won the game easily with
    the rocket launcher and it seems to me that it might get nerfed a bit.
    I have decided to set a goal and reach 500 squad wins by the end of the week.
    I am ending the day with 452 wins in squads already.
