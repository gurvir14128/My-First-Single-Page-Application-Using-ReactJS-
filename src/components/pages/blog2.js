    My cousins wanted to play fortnite with me and 
    I agrred, since it had been awhile since I played with them.
    We started out strong and won our very first game. After our first win
    we hit a rough patch and didn't win for the next 3 hours. 
    However, I got to practice more with the sniper which is great. The 
    sniper is still my weakest weapon and I need to use 
    it more, so I can become more effective with it. I hit a 
    shot form 221 meters, which was impressive. After losing for few
    hours, we finally started winning again. I ended the day 
    with 468 wins!
