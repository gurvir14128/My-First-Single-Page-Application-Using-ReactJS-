# My-First-Single-Page-Application-Using-ReactJS-
I created a blog site in which I tell the readders about what I did in fortnite that day and what I want to achieve
in that videogame. In the header I included an image, I included my psn in the footer and my goals. The navigation gives links to 
blog posts from 3 consequtive days and the main shows the actual post for each day. 

To the run the app I did the following:
Downloaded nodeJS
Created a folder on my desktop named Assignment4
I went to the cmd and navigated to this folder
I typed in npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app fortnite
cd fortnite
I used gulp, so I could use scss and convert it to css used in my app.
npm gulp-cli -g
npm install gulp -D
I created a gulpfile.js and then did the following in the cmd in the fortnite directory:
npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
npm install gulp-clean --save-dev
npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev
npm install gulp-rename --save-dev
npm install gulp-changed --save-dev

Finally once I created the components and used the gulp to convert my scss to css and had all the files under the fortnite director I was able to run it. To run my app go to the cmd and cd to the fortnite directory and then enter:
npm start

Enjoy reading about my fortnite adventures!
